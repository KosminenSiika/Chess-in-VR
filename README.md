This is the source code for a VR Game/Application made for the Mixed Reality and Metaverse course at the University of Turku. 

The game is a VR implementation of chess where you interact with the pieces and turn clock in a natural way using your VR controllers. Chess is played against a computer opponent, which uses Fairy-Stockfish (available here https://fairy-stockfish.github.io/) as the chess engine. The player can choose which pieces to play with, the time available for each colour as well as the difficulty of the computer opponent. Difficulty ranges from 1 to 8 emulating the difficulties available on Lichess (https://lichess.org/).

Difficulty 1 ~ under 400 elo
Difficulty 2 ~ 500 elo
Difficulty 3 ~ 800 elo
Difficulty 4 ~ 1100 elo
Difficulty 5 ~ 1500 elo
